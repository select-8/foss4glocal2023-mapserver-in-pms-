            Hello. My name is Liam O'Connor, I'm a GIS Developer and Product owner at Compass Informatics. 
            My presentation today is going to be about the utilisation of MapServer in an asset management system. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The asset in question here is the Irish Road Network and the application is called The Pavement Management System or PMS, 
            <br>
            <br>
            …but more on that in a bit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For now I'd like to set the scene and provide some context to the presentation.

            <strong>Compass Informatics</strong> was started in Dublin in 1997, being one of the first home grown companies to utilise GIS in a commercial capacity.<br>
            <br>
            It continued to grow successfully over the next two decades, focusing broadly on transportation, environment & natural resources, utilities, 
            and planning. Fostering long standing relationships with Irish national bodies such as the National Transport Association, 
            Irish Water and The Environmental Protection Agency to name but a few.<br>
            <br>
            In 2019 Compass was acquired by <strong>Tracsis Plc.</strong><br>
            Tracsis is a software house started from Leeds University in 2005.<br>
            Initially focused on Rail Crew Optimisation, Tracsis Plc now has over 15 acquired business units, all operating within the transportation, 
            software and services arena<br>
            within the UK, Ireland and the US.<br>
            In 2021 Tracsis Plc acquired another Irish company IconGeo.<br>
            This acquisition further compliments and expands on Compass Informatics Earth Observation capabilities. 
            And here I must give a plug for my colleague Adriaan who gave a talk earlier this morning at the Maynooth FOSS4G Local today titled: 
            Deep learning and Sentinel-1 for grazing detection in Ireland, so check that out on YouTube if you can.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>The LGMA</strong> is a state agency that provides a range of professional services to local authorities. 
            They work collaboratively with all 31 local authorities in Ireland to support the delivery of local government services and policy. 
            They also help local authorities to implement change and enhance performance.<br>
            The Local Authorities themselves, represented by the LGMA, are our end users. 
            Specifically Civil, Road and Safety Engineers along with GIS Technicians and GIS Data Officers.<br>
            <br>
            Then we have the <strong>Road Management Office.</strong> The RMO's function is to Provide to Local Authorities in Ireland centralised supports, 
            forums, guidelines and technology to support improved roads asset management outcomes and consistency in road maintenance and investment.<br>
            <br>
            The Pavement Management System is one of the main conduits through which this is achieved.<br>
            <br>
            So that's the stakeholders.<br>
            Next I'd like to provide some context around the title of this Presentation, and answer the question 
            I'm sure some you have asked yourselves, What is a Pavement anyway?

        Particularly of late, the capture of Active Travel Infrastructure…that is pavements for walking and/or cycling on… 
        in the Pavement Management System, has become a major focus for the RMO and Local Authorities.

    <h3>What is a Pavement anyway?</h3>
    <em>A <b>pavement</b>, in civil engineering terms, is a human-made surface on natural ground that people, vehicles or animals can cross.</em>

    <aside class="notes">
        However, in the context of The Pavement Management System, we are using the civil engineering term,<br>
        where a pavement is:<br>any human-made surface on natural ground that people, vehicles or animals can cross.

    <p>And the <b>Management System</b>?</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        This began life as a desktop GIS in MapInfo in the 1990s.<br>
        Compass first got involved in the project in 2010, creating a web frontend. <br>
        At this point it was still installed in each LA on their own web servers and database servers.<br>
        While this began to bring some structure to managing pavements in Ireland, over time, the need for a centralised data management system became apparent. 
        To this end, in 2016, Compass, working with the RMO, began development of a web-based system with a centralised data repository.<br>
